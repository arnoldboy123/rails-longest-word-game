This is a Le Wagon bootcamp exercise to get familiar with making Rails application.

This game provides the user with a list of valid letters. The user should try to the longest valid word using the letters given.

To check whether a word is valid, we use the `wagon-dictionary API` here: https://wagon-dictionary.herokuapp.com/

If you would like to run this application, download the file and run it on your local server.
